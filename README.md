Overview:
Hello! This GitHub contains all the code we used in our extension; Cookie_Lexic
For our dear friend Lily, we embarked on the daunting task of coding an entire web extension. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript we created a, in our opinion, beautiful extension. While we are still working on sorting out security and technical issues, the extension works within itself (so we had something incredible to show for all our hard work).

Thank you MIT CRE[AT]E-BWSI Challenge for this incredible opportunity and experience!

Key Components:
- Font Changer
- Text Size Slider
- Color/Background/Overlay Selection

How to Use:
Download the file and open a Chrome webpage. Press the puzzle icon and 'manage extensions'. In the top corner switch to 'developer mode' and press 'load unpacked'. Choose the correct file and the extension should pop up in the blank area! Refresh and the extension's icon will appear in the extensions bar! You did it!
