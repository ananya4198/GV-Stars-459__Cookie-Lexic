Overview:
Hello! This GitHub contains all the code we used in our extension; Cookie_Lexic
For our dear friend Lily, we embarked on the daunting task of coding an entire web extension. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript we created a, in our opinion, beautiful extension. While we are still working on sorting out security and technical issues, the extension works within itself (so we had something incredible to show for all our hard work).

Thank you MIT CRE[AT]E-BWSI Challenge for this incredible opportunity and experience!

Key Components:
- Font Changer
- Text Size Slider
- Color/Background/Overlay Selection

Build Instructions:
To create a Chrome extension, a manifest.json must first be created so that Chrome can identify the code as an extension. Next, you will need to add an action that allow the defalt program to display a popup, as this will be the control panel to our extension. If desired, an image can be chosen to use as a logo. For this, upload 3 images of sizes, 128, 32, and 16 pixels so it may be seen on many devices. Back to the extension itself, pre-made CSS files can be downloaded and uploaded into the file, or they can be hand-made. We used the bulma.min.css framework for this particular project. We then used HTML to phsyical manifest our buttons, sliders, and radios(smaller circular buttons). After the designing was complete, the last step is to code the extension using JavaScript. Some fonts may be included with the software you use, however more niche scripts such as OpenDyslexic (which we needed) must be downloaded, converted, and then represented into the code. Through collected all the data we had coded within the extension, we were able to manipulate it just as we needed, thus creating our final project.


How to Use:
Download the file and open a Chrome webpage. Press the puzzle icon and 'manage extensions'. In the top corner switch to 'developer mode' and press 'load unpacked'. Choose the correct file and the extension should pop up in the blank area! Refresh and the extension's icon will appear in the extensions bar! You did it!
